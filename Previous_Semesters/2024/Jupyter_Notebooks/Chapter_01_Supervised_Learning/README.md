You should work your way through the notebooks in the following order:


# [1. Linear Regression](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Chapter_01_Supervised_Learning/01-Linear%20Regression/01-Linear_Regression.ipynb)
In this notebook we solve the problem of Regression from scratch using only numpy. We also experiment wih Polynomial Regression and use sklearn to solve real-world problems.

**Warning!** If you want to run this notebook online, make sure you run the following code to download the dataset:
```
!kaggle datasets download -d mokar2001/house-price-tehran-iran
!unzip house-price-tehran-iran.zip -d ./assets
```
And change the excel loading:
```
file_path = './assets/housePrice.xlsx'
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)
```
To csv loading:
```
file_path = './assets/housePrice.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```
Or alternatively, you could just run the following code:
```
!mkdir -p ./assets
!wget -O ./assets/housePrice.xlsx https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SharifiZarchi/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Chapter_01_Supervised_Learning/01-Linear%20Regression/assets/housePrice.xlsx
```

In this notebook we use implement the Decision Tree Classifiers from scratch and explore how ensembling different models improve classification. 
We also work with Random Forests and XGBoost and compare their results.
