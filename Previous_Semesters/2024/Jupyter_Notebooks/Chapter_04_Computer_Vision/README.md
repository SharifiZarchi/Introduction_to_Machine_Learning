You should work your way through the notebooks in the following order:


# [1. Convolutional Neural Networks from Scratch](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Chapter_04_Computer_Vision/CNNs_from_scratch.ipynb)
In this notebook we implement and train a convolutional neural network from scratch using only numpy, based on [our implementation from the previous chapter](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Chapter_03_Neural_Networks/NNs_from_scratch.ipynb).
Additionally we implement the same model using PyTorch.

# [2. AlexNet Architecture](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Chapter_04_Computer_Vision/AlexNet.ipynb)
In this notebook we implement the [AlexNet](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks) architecture in PyTorch.
Moreover we go over different augmentation techniques that are widely used on image datasets.

# [3. Residual Networks and Transfer Learning](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Chapter_04_Computer_Vision/ResNets_Transfer_Learning.ipynb)
In this notebook we will explore the effect of residual connections in deep convolutional neural networks and experiment with the ResNet architecture.
Additionally we observe how transfer learning can help us improve the training process by using pretrained models.

# [4. AutoEncoders](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Chapter_04_Computer_Vision/AutoEncoders.ipynb)
In this notebook we experiment with AutoEncoders and observe how they can reduce the dimensionality of the data by visualizing their latent space.
We also work with Denoising AutoEncoders and see how AutoEncoders can be used for getting rid of unwanted noise.

# [5. UNet](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Chapter_04_Computer_Vision/UNet.ipynb)
In this notebook we introduce the U - Net architecture and investigate its use cases in different tasks of computer vision.
