    "Welcome to our PyTorch tutorial for the Deep Learning course 2023 at the University of Amsterdam! The following notebook is meant to give a short introduction to PyTorch basics, and get you setup for writing your own neural networks. PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that allows you to write your own neural networks and optimize them efficiently. However, PyTorch is not the only framework of its kind. Alternatives to PyTorch include [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#quickstart-colab-in-the-cloud) and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). We choose to teach PyTorch at the University of Amsterdam because it is well established, has a huge developer community (originally developed by Facebook), is very flexible and especially used in research. Many current papers publish their code in PyTorch, and thus it is good to be familiar with PyTorch as well.\n",
    "Meanwhile, TensorFlow (developed by Google) is usually known for being a production-grade deep learning library. Still, if you know one machine learning framework in depth, it is very easy to learn another one because many of them use the same concepts and ideas. For instance, TensorFlow's version 2 was heavily inspired by the most popular features of PyTorch, making the frameworks even more similar.\n",
    "If you are already familiar with PyTorch and have created your own neural network projects, feel free to just skim this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are of course not the first ones to create a PyTorch tutorial. There are many great tutorials online, including the [\"60-min blitz\"](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) on the official [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/). Yet, we choose to create our own tutorial which is designed to give you the basics particularly necessary for the practicals, but still understand how PyTorch works under the hood. Over the next few weeks, we will also keep exploring new PyTorch features in the series of Jupyter notebook tutorials about deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a set of standard libraries that are often used in machine learning projects. If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, all libraries should be pre-installed. If you are running this notebook locally, make sure you have installed our `dl2023` environment and have activated it."

You should therefore see the output `Using torch 2.1.0` or `Using torch 2.0.0`, eventually with some extension for the CUDA version on Colab. In case you use the `dl2023` environment, you should see `Using torch 2.1.0`. In general, it is recommended to keep the PyTorch version updated to the newest one. If you see a lower version number than 2.0, make sure you have installed the correct environment, or ask one of your TAs. In case PyTorch 2.2 or newer will be published during the time of the course, don't worry. The interface between PyTorch versions doesn't change too much, and hence all code should also be runnable with newer versions.\n",

    "One of the main reasons for using PyTorch in Deep Learning projects is that we can automatically get **gradients/derivatives** of functions that we define. We will mainly use PyTorch for implementing neural networks, and they are just fancy functions. If we use weight matrices in our function that we want to learn, then those are called the **parameters** or simply the **weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our neural network would output a single scalar value, we would talk about taking the **derivative**, but you will see that quite often we will have **multiple** output variables (\"values\"); in that case we talk about **gradients**. It's a more general term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input $\\mathbf{x}$, we define our function by **manipulating** that input, usually by matrix-multiplications with weight matrices and additions with so-called bias vectors. As we manipulate our input, we are automatically creating a **computational graph**. This graph shows how to arrive at our output from our input.\n",
    "PyTorch is a **define-by-run** framework; this means that we can just do our manipulations, and PyTorch will keep track of that graph for us. Thus, we create a dynamic computation graph along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to recap: the only thing we have to do is to compute the **output**, and then we can ask PyTorch to automatically get the **gradients**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:  Why do we want gradients?** Consider that we have defined a function, a neural net, that is supposed to compute a certain output $y$ for an input vector $\\mathbf{x}$. We then define an **error measure** that tells us how wrong our network is; how bad it is in predicting output $y$ from input $\\mathbf{x}$. Based on this error measure, we can use the gradients to **update** the weights $\\mathbf{W}$ that were responsible for the output, so that the next time we present input $\\mathbf{x}$ to our network, the output will be closer to what we want.\n",

However, PyTorch already provides a list of predefined loss functions which we can use (see [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions) for a full list). For instance, for BCE, PyTorch has two modules: `nn.BCELoss()`, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()`. While `nn.BCELoss` expects the inputs $x$ to be in the range $[0,1]$, i.e. the output of a sigmoid, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` combines a sigmoid layer and the BCE loss in a single class. This version is numerically more stable than using a plain Sigmoid followed by a BCE loss because of the logarithms applied in the loss function. Hence, it is adviced to use loss functions applied on \"logits\" where possible (remember to not apply a sigmoid on the output of the model in this case!). For our model defined above, we therefore use the module `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`."

If we call the `backward` function on the loss while the parameter gradients are non-zero from the previous batch, the new gradients would actually be added to the previous ones instead of overwriting them.
